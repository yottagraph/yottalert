# Graph

The graph endpoints are focused on "graph analysis". This includes, but is not limited to, visual rendering of a graph.

## When to Use

- You want to explore the entities that are most directly related to a given center entity (the "neighborhood" of entities)
- You want to understand the relationships between entities and their neighbors
- You need to create a visual representation of entity relationships
- You need layout coordinates for rendering a graph

## Key Concepts

- **Graph Layout**: Computed positions for nodes (entities) and edges (relationships)
- **Neighborhood**: The set of entities directly connected to a focal entity
- **Neighborhood History**: How the neighborhood has changed over time

## Tips

- Start with a single focal entity (center NEID) to get its immediate neighborhood
- Graph endpoints return relationships between entities as well as layout data optimized for visualization

## Endpoints

### Get graph layout

`GET /graph/{center_neid}/layout`

Get nodes and edges layout data for visualizing a relationship graph. Response is cached for 5 minutes.

#### Guidance

This should always be called with a non-empty list of neids. A typical pattern is to call /graph/{center_neid}/neighborhood and then use the returned NEIDs to call this endpoint.

#### Parameters

| Name        | Type     | Required | Description                                  |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| center_neid | string   | yes      | Center entity NEID                           |
| neid        | string[] | no       | Additional entity NEIDs to include in layout |
| borderMinX  | number   | no       | Minimum X border for layout                  |
| borderMinY  | number   | no       | Minimum Y border for layout                  |
| borderMaxX  | number   | no       | Maximum X border for layout                  |
| borderMaxY  | number   | no       | Maximum Y border for layout                  |
