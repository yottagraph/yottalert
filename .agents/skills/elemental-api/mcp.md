# MCP Tools

The Elemental MCP server provides agent-friendly tools for exploring the Lovelace Knowledge Graph. All tools accept entity **names** (resolved automatically), **NEIDs**, or **structured IDs** — no manual PID lookups or NEID zero-padding required.

## When to Use MCP vs REST

| Path                                  | Best for                                                             | Docs                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **MCP Tools**                         | Interactive exploration, Cursor agent workflows, multi-step research | This file                                 |
| **REST API** (`useElementalClient()`) | Building app features, UI components, server routes                  | entities.md, find.md, schema.md, graph.md |

Both paths access the same knowledge graph. MCP tools handle entity resolution,
property name fuzzy-matching, and NEID formatting automatically — the REST API
requires you to manage these yourself (see entities.md and schema.md).

## Tools

### elemental_get_schema

Discover entity types, properties, and relationships.

| Param  | Type   | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| flavor | string | Entity type to inspect — fuzzy-matched (e.g. "company" matches "organization"). Omit to list available flavors. |
| query  | string | Natural language search within a flavor's schema (e.g. "revenue"). Requires flavor.                             |

**Usage pattern:**

1. Call with no arguments to list available flavors.
2. Pick a flavor and call again to see its properties and relationships.
3. Add a query to search within a flavor's schema (e.g. "trustee", "revenue").

**Response:** When no flavor is given, returns `flavors[]` (name, description). When a flavor is given, returns `properties[]` (name, type, domain_flavors) and `relationships[]` (name, type, domain_flavors, target_flavors). When the input was fuzzy-matched, a `resolution` object explains the rewrite.

### elemental_get_entity

Look up an entity and optionally fetch its properties.

| Param      | Type     | Description                                                                               |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| entity     | string   | Entity name or NEID. Required unless entity_id is provided.                               |
| entity_id  | object   | Structured identifier: `{id_type, id}`. Use instead of entity for exact ID lookups.       |
| flavor     | string   | Disambiguate ambiguous names (e.g. "Apollo" could be a PE firm or healthcare company).    |
| snippet    | string   | Free-text context for disambiguation (e.g. "the chemical element").                       |
| properties | string[] | Property names to fetch (e.g. `["total_revenue", "industry"]`). Fuzzy-matched.            |
| history    | object   | Include historical values instead of latest snapshot. Fields: `limit`, `after`, `before`. |

**Entity ID types:** `"neid"` for direct NEID lookup; `"company_cik"`, `"ein"`, `"imo_number"`, `"lei_code"`, etc. for strong ID search.

**Response:** Returns `entity` with NEID, name, flavor, confidence score, and requested property values. Properties include citation markers (e.g. `[1]`). When history is set, returns `historical_properties` with timestamped value arrays instead.

### elemental_get_related

| flavor / snippet   |          | Disambiguation (same as get_entity).                                                                    |
| related_flavor     | string   | **Required.** Type of related entities to find (e.g. "person", "organization", "event"). Fuzzy-matched. |
| relationship_types | string[] | Filter by relationship type (e.g. `["owns", "board_member_of"]`). Fuzzy-matched.                        |
| direction          | string   | `"outgoing"` (center is subject), `"incoming"` (center is object), or `"both"` (default).               |
| related_properties | string[] | Properties to fetch on each related entity.                                                             |
| time_range         | object   | Filter by date: `{after, before}` (ISO date strings).                                                   |
| limit              | integer  | Max related entities to return (default 50).                                                            |

### elemental_get_relationships

### elemental_health

Check server health and connectivity.

No parameters. Returns health status, version, and uptime.

## Key Capabilities

### Fuzzy Matching

All flavor, property, and relationship names are fuzzy-matched. Approximate names work:

- "company" matches "organization"
- "ship" matches "vessel"
- "revenue" matches "total_revenue"

When a name is rewritten, the response includes a `resolution` object explaining
what happened (e.g. `"company" matched to "organization"`).

### Entity Resolution

Every tool that accepts an entity supports three input modes:

1. **Name search** — `entity: "Apple"` resolves via the entity resolver with scored ranking.
2. **NEID lookup** — `entity: "00416400910670863867"` bypasses the resolver. NEIDs of 10+ digits are auto-detected.
3. **Structured ID** — `entity_id: {id_type: "company_cik", id: "0000320193"}` for exact lookups by CIK, EIN, IMO, LEI, etc.

Use `snippet` to help disambiguate common names (e.g. `entity: "Mercury", snippet: "the chemical element"`).

Low-confidence matches (below 80%) include a `low_confidence: true` flag and a warning message so the agent can verify before proceeding.

### Citation Tracking

Tools automatically track which data sources back each fact. Property values
include citation markers like `[1]`, `[2]` that reference the bibliography.

Retrieve the full bibliography (titles, URLs, dates) with `elemental_get_bibliography`
or by reading the `session://elemental/bibliography` resource.
