# Data Dictionary: Wikipedia

## Source Overview

Wikipedia is a multilingual open encyclopedia. This source extracts biographical, geographic, and organizational entities from English Wikipedia (`en.wikipedia.org`), producing a `wikipedia_summary` property containing the article's introductory paragraph.

Entity classification is performed using the Wikidata truthy dump — each Wikipedia article links to a Wikidata item via a QID (e.g., Q42 = Douglas Adams), and the Wikidata P31 (instance of) property provides structured type information. Summaries are fetched via the MediaWiki API's `extracts` module, which returns clean plaintext intro sections.

No LLM calls are used in this pipeline. All extraction is deterministic.

| Pipeline     | `Record.Source` |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| All entities | `wikipedia`     |

**Update cadence:** Initial load processes a Wikidata truthy dump plus SQL dumps for classification (~1-2 hours offline), then fetches summaries via the MediaWiki API (~2 days for ~3-4M entities). Incremental updates poll the Wikipedia RecentChanges API on a configurable interval (e.g., daily) and re-fetch summaries for changed articles.

## Entity Types

### `person`

A human being with an English Wikipedia article, classified via Wikidata P31 = Q5 (human).

- Primary key: `wikidata_qid`
- Entity resolver: named entity, mergeable. Strong ID = `wikidata_qid`.

### `location`

A geographic entity (city, country, sovereign state, town, village, settlement, etc.) with an English Wikipedia article, classified via Wikidata P31 matching location-related types (Q515, Q6256, Q3624078, Q532, Q3957, Q486972, etc.).

- Primary key: `wikidata_qid`
- Entity resolver: named entity, mergeable. Strong ID = `wikidata_qid`.

### `organization`

A company, business, institution, or organizational entity with an English Wikipedia article, classified via Wikidata P31 matching organization-related types (Q43229, Q4830453, Q783794, Q6881511, Q891723, etc.).

- Primary key: `wikidata_qid`
- Entity resolver: named entity, mergeable. Strong ID = `wikidata_qid`.

## Properties

### Shared Properties (all entity types)

#### Identity

- `wikidata_qid`
    - Definition: Wikidata item identifier. Globally unique, stable, never reused.
    - Examples: `"Q42"` (Douglas Adams), `"Q62"` (San Francisco), `"Q312"` (Apple Inc.)
    - Derivation: From Wikidata truthy dump (initial load) or MediaWiki API `pageprops.wikibase_item` (incremental updates).

- `wikibase_shortdesc`
    - Definition: Short human-readable description from Wikidata, typically one line summarizing what the entity is.
    - Examples: `"English author, humorist, and screenwriter"` (Q42), `"City and county in California, United States"` (Q62), `"American multinational technology company"` (Q312)
    - Derivation: From `page_props.sql.gz` dump field `wikibase-shortdesc` (initial load) or MediaWiki API `pageprops` with `ppprop=wikibase-shortdesc` (incremental updates).

#### Content

- `wikipedia_summary`
    - Definition: The first paragraph of the entity's English Wikipedia article intro, in plain text.
    - Examples:
        - (Douglas Adams) `"Douglas Noël Adams (11 March 1952 – 11 May 2001) was an English author, humorist, and screenwriter, best known as the creator of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Originally a 1978 BBC radio comedy, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy evolved into a \"trilogy\" of six books..."`
        - (San Francisco) `"San Francisco, officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the fourth-most populous city in California and the 17th-most populous in the United States..."`
    - Derivation: From the full intro text (MediaWiki API or XML dump extraction), split at the first paragraph break.

- `wikipedia_extended_summary`
    - Definition: The remaining paragraphs of the entity's English Wikipedia article intro beyond the first paragraph, in plain text. Empty for articles with only a single introductory paragraph.
    - Examples:
        - (Albert Einstein, paragraph 2) `"Born in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year..."`
    - Derivation: Paragraphs 2+ of the intro text, after splitting off the first paragraph for `wikipedia_summary`.

### Snippet

The snippet combines the Wikidata short description with the first sentence(s) of the article in the format: `"{wikibase_shortdesc} | {first sentence(s)}"`. Sentences are accumulated until the total snippet reaches ~300 characters. This format gives immediate topical context from the short description plus grounding detail from the article itself.

Example (Apple Inc.): `"American multinational technology company | Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, in Silicon Valley, best known for its consumer electronics, software and online services."`

## Entity Relationships

Relationships are extracted from Wikidata P-properties in the truthy dump. Each
relationship connects a subject entity to a target entity, both of which must be
classified (person, location, or organization). All extraction is deterministic.

### Person → Location
