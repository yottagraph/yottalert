# Data Dictionary: GLEIF

## Source Overview

GLEIF (Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation) publishes the Legal Entity
Identifier (LEI) system — a global reference data standard for legal entities
participating in financial transactions. The data is updated three times daily
via the Golden Copy and is freely accessible through a public REST API.

The GLEIF dataset provides two levels of data:

- **Level 1**: Entity reference data ("who is who") — ~3.25M legal entities
- **Level 2**: Relationship data ("who owns whom") — direct and ultimate
  parent relationships

## Entity Types

### `organization`

A legal entity registered in the global LEI system. Includes corporations,
funds, branches, sole proprietorships, and other legal entity types
worldwide.

- Primary key: `lei` (20-character alphanumeric Legal Entity Identifier)
- Entity resolver: named entity, mergeable. Strong ID = `lei`.
  Disambiguation via legal name, jurisdiction, headquarters address.
  Other names and transliterated names as aliases.

## Entity Relationships

### Ownership (Level 2 data)

Derived from the GLEIF API `include=direct-parent,ultimate-parent`
relationship data on LEI records.

- `direct_parent`
    - Definition: The entity is directly consolidated by (directly owned
      or controlled by) the target parent entity.
    - Examples: "Bloomberg L.P. has direct parent Bloomberg Inc."
    - Derivation: `relationships.direct-parent.data.id` when the
      relationship type is `"lei-records"` (not `"reporting-exceptions"`).
    - Note: Not all entities report parent relationships. Reporting
      exceptions are logged but do not produce relationship atoms.

- `ultimate_parent`
    - Definition: The entity is ultimately consolidated by (ultimately
      owned or controlled by) the target parent entity at the top of
      the corporate hierarchy.
    - Examples: "Bloomberg Finance L.P. has ultimate parent Bloomberg Inc."
    - Derivation: `relationships.ultimate-parent.data.id` when the
      relationship type is `"lei-records"`.
    - Note: When direct parent equals ultimate parent, both relationships
      are still emitted.

Inverse lookups (parent → subsidiaries) are handled by the DB/agent layer
via inverse queries on `direct_parent` and `ultimate_parent`.

```
organization ──[direct_parent]──────→ organization   (Level 2, child → parent)
organization ──[ultimate_parent]────→ organization   (Level 2, child → ultimate parent)
```
