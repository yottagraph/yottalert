# Data Dictionary: FDIC

## Purpose

This dictionary documents the entity types, properties, and relationships that the FDIC source contributes to the Lovelace knowledge graph.

FDIC ingests data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's BankFind Suite API (`https://api.fdic.gov/banks/`), which provides public data on all FDIC-insured depository institutions in the United States. The source covers:

- **Institution profiles**: identity, location, charter, and regulatory information for ~4,300 active and ~27,800 total (including inactive) FDIC-insured banks and thrifts
- **Quarterly financial data**: balance sheet and income statement figures from Call Reports (FFIEC 031/041/051), updated quarterly with data back to 1984
- **Bank failures**: all 4,100+ FDIC-insured institution failures since 1934, including resolution details and acquiring institution

Financial figures are reported in thousands of USD as filed in Call Reports. Not all institutions report all fields; smaller banks (FFIEC 051 filers) report a reduced set.

**Source names used on records:**

| Pipeline                          | `Record.Source` |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Institution profiles + financials | `fdic`          |
| Bank failures                     | `fdic_failure`  |

- Entity resolver: named entity. Strong ID = `fdic_certificate_number`. Disambiguation context includes institution name, city, state, and holding company name. Prior names serve as aliases.
- Sources: `fdic`, `fdic_failure`

## Attributes

FDIC records do not use source-specific attributes beyond the standard citation text on atoms.

- **Institution atoms**: citation text follows the pattern `"FDIC BankFind: {field_description} for {institution_name} (CERT: {cert})"`.
- **Financial atoms**: citation text follows the pattern `"FDIC Call Report ({report_date}): {field_description} for {institution_name} (CERT: {cert})"`.
- **Failure atoms**: citation text follows the pattern `"FDIC Failure: {institution_name} failed {failure_date}"`.
