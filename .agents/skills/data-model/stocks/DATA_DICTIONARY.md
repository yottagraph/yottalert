# Data Dictionary: Alpha Vantage Stocks

## Source Overview

Alpha Vantage stock market data via the `TIME_SERIES_DAILY` REST API. Provides daily OHLCV (open, high, low, close, volume) candlestick data for US-listed equities on NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX exchanges.

Historical data available via `outputsize=full` (20+ years). Recent data (last 100 trading days) available via `outputsize=compact`. The streamer uses `full` for initial backfill and `compact` for daily incremental updates.

Symbol universe: ~6,900 tickers (after filtering preferred stock symbols) sourced from the NASDAQ screener (static CSV, downloaded 2026-03-13). Symbols containing `^` (preferred shares) are excluded because Alpha Vantage does not support them.

Rate limit: 1,200 requests/minute (premium plan). Downloads run concurrently (10 workers) with the Alpha Vantage client rate limiter gating throughput.

## Notes

- **Timestamps**: Alpha Vantage returns timestamps in US/Eastern time. All atom timestamps are converted to UTC before storage.
- **Adjusted prices**: The daily endpoint returns raw (as-traded) prices. Split/dividend-adjusted data is available via `TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED` (premium) but is not currently used.
- **Missing data**: Not all symbols have data for all dates. Candles only exist for days with trading activity.
- **Streaming model**: HandleStream runs as a continuous polling loop. First run downloads full history (`outputsize=full`). Subsequent runs download compact data (`outputsize=compact`, last 100 trading days) and atomize only candles newer than the checkpoint. Default poll interval: 24 hours.
- **Preferred stock symbols**: Tickers containing `^` (e.g., `AHT^F`, `F^C`) are filtered out during symbol loading because Alpha Vantage returns empty responses for them.
