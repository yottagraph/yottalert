# Data Dictionary — BNY Arbitrage Rebate Analysis

## Source Description

Interim Arbitrage Rebate Analysis reports prepared by BLX Group LLC for

include transmittal letters, legal opinions, notes/assumptions, summary
schedules (rebate analysis, sources/uses of funds), and detailed per-fund
cash flow and investment data.

BNY (Bank of New York Mellon) serves as trustee. Orrick, Herrington &
Sutcliffe LLP provides the accompanying legal opinion.

## Table Extraction

### Schedule A — Summary of Rebate Analysis

Maps to `rebate_analysis` table config. Key column: Fund Description.
Each row becomes a `fund_account` entity with properties for status,
valuation, earnings, IRR, and excess earnings.

### Schedule B — Sources & Uses of Funds

Maps to `sources_of_funds` and `uses_of_funds` table configs. Uses
`document_entity_from_title` mode to attach line items as properties
on the bond entity.

### Security Holdings (Schedules C1, D1, F1, G1)

Maps to `security_tables` config. Key column: Security Type. Each
security becomes a `financial_instrument` entity scoped by fund
account title. Properties: par amount, coupon, maturity, yield, etc.

### Cash Flow Tables (Schedules C2, D2, E1, F2, G2)

New table config needed. These are the largest tables — hundreds of rows
of deposit/withdrawal transactions for each fund account. Columns:
Date, Description, Cash Flow, Muni-Days/Computation Date, FV Factor
at bond yield, FV As Of at bond yield, FV Factor at IRR, FV As Of at IRR.
