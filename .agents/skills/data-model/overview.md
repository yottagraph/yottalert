# Data Model Overview

The Lovelace knowledge graph is populated by multiple fetch sources. This document explains how to navigate the per-source documentation.

## Source Index

Use this table to find which source to consult for different types of information:

| Looking for...                                      | Check these sources |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Public company data, SEC filings                    | edgar               |
| Bank and financial institution data                 | fdic                |
| Macroeconomic indicators, rates                     | fred                |
| Legal Entity Identifiers (LEI), corporate ownership | gleif               |
| News articles and press releases                    | newsdata            |
| Prediction markets                                  | polymarket          |
| Sanctions lists, compliance data                    | sanctions           |
| Stock prices, OHLCV market data                     | stocks              |
| People, places, organizations (general knowledge)   | wikipedia           |

## Documentation Structure

Each source directory contains:

| File                 | Purpose                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATA_DICTIONARY.md` | Human-readable documentation of entity types, properties, relationships, and data pipelines |
| `schema.yaml`        | Machine-readable schema definition                                                          |

Not all sources have both files. Check `SKILL.md` for which files each source provides.

## Common Concepts

All sources share these concepts:

- **Flavors**: Entity types (e.g., `organization`, `person`). Some are namespaced like `sec::10_k`.
- **Properties**: Fields on entities with types, descriptions, and domain flavors.
- **Relationships**: Links between entities (e.g., `issued_by`, `works_at`).
- **Strong IDs**: Properties that uniquely identify entities across sources (e.g., `company_cik`, `lei`).

## How Sources Interact

Entities from different sources can merge when they share a **strong ID**. For example, an organization from EDGAR and the same organization from sanctions will merge if they share an `lei` value.

Each source's DATA_DICTIONARY.md documents:

- Which entity types it creates
- What strong IDs it uses for resolution
- How its entities relate to other sources

## Schema Structure

Each `schema.yaml` follows this structure:

```yaml
name: 'source_name'
description: 'What this source provides'

extraction:
    flavors: closed # or open - whether new flavors can be added
    properties: closed
    relationships: closed

flavors:
    - name: 'entity_type'
      mergeability: not_mergeable # or mergeable
      strong_id_properties: ['prop_name']

properties:
    - name: 'property_name'
      type: string
      domain_flavors: ['entity_type']

relationships:
    - name: 'relationship_name'
      domain_flavors: ['source_type']
      target_flavors: ['target_type']
```
