# Data Dictionary: Polymarket

## Purpose

Polymarket is a prediction market platform where users trade on the outcomes of real-world events. The Lovelace Polymarket pipeline polls the [Gamma API](https://gamma-api.polymarket.com) for active and recently closed events, extracts real-world entities from event text via LLM, and atomizes both the LLM extraction results and structured market data (prices, volumes, outcomes) into Records.

Events are polled on a configurable interval (default: every 15 minutes). Each poll fetches all active events (paginated by volume, up to 10,000) and the top 1,000 recently closed events. LLM extraction is skipped for events whose title and description have not changed since the previous poll cycle. Series data is fetched from the `/series` endpoint for events that belong to a recurring series.

The pipeline has two data paths:

- **LLM extraction**: event title, description, market questions, category, and tags are composed into a document and sent to an LLM to extract real-world entities (people, organizations, locations, etc.), relationships, events, and sentiment.
- **Structured atomization**: event metadata, market statistics, and series data are atomized directly from the Gamma API JSON response without LLM involvement.
