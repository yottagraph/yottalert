# Data Dictionary: FRED

## Purpose

This dictionary documents the entity types, properties, and attributes that the FRED source contributes to the Lovelace knowledge graph. It serves as the contract between the FRED source and everything that consumes it: ingest, the query server, UI, and downstream sources.

FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) is a database maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis containing over 800,000 economic time series from hundreds of sources. The Lovelace FRED source ingests a curated set of ~144 macroeconomically significant series spanning GDP, employment, inflation, interest rates, housing, money supply, financial markets, and commodity prices.

**Pipeline:** Download → Extract → Atomize. For each series, the pipeline fetches metadata (`/series`), observations (`/series/observations`), release information (`/series/release`), and categories (`/series/categories`) from the FRED API. One record is produced per series, containing metadata atoms followed by one observation atom per data point.

**Cadence:** Series are re-downloaded on each run. Only series whose observations have changed since the last run are re-atomized and re-published. Runs are periodic (typically daily to weekly).

**Observation sparsity:** FRED uses `"."` as a missing-value sentinel. Missing observations are silently dropped — only numeric values are emitted.

**Record chunking:** Series with many observations (e.g. daily data spanning decades) may be split into multiple records of up to `MaxAtomsPerRecord` atoms each.

**Source name:** `fred-source`
