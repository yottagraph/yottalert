# Data Dictionary: EDGAR

## Source Overview

SEC EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) filings via two pipelines:

- **Company facts / XBRL**: structured financial data from `companyfacts.zip` and `submissions.zip` bulk APIs
- **Form parsing**: regulatory forms (10-K, 10-Q, 20-F, 8-K, Form 3/4, SC 13D/G, 13F-HR, DEF 14A) parsed from HTML, XML, and SGML documents

Financial figures from XBRL may be computed fallbacks when a company does not file the authoritative tag. Not all companies report all fields.

## Entity Types

### `organization`

A public company, institutional investor, or corporate filer registered with the SEC.

- Primary key: `company_cik` (10-digit zero-padded CIK)
- Entity resolver: named entity. Strong ID = `company_cik`. Disambiguation via company name, city, state, SIC description, EIN. Ticker and former names as aliases.
- Financial metrics from XBRL are dual-homed on both the filing document and the organization, with a `filing_period` attribute (`FY`, `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3`) to distinguish annual from quarterly values.

### SEC Filing Types (namespace: `sec`)

Each SEC form type is a separate flavor, namespaced under `sec`. All share the same strong ID (`accession_number`) and are not mergeable.

| Flavor         | Display Name | Description                                  |
| -------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `sec::10_k`    | 10-K         | Annual report                                |
| `sec::10_q`    | 10-Q         | Quarterly report                             |
| `sec::20_f`    | 20-F         | Foreign private issuer annual report         |
| `sec::8_k`     | 8-K          | Current report (material events)             |
| `sec::form_3`  | Form 3       | Initial statement of beneficial ownership    |
| `sec::form_4`  | Form 4       | Statement of changes in beneficial ownership |
| `sec::sc_13d`  | SC 13D       | Beneficial ownership report (activist)       |
| `sec::sc_13g`  | SC 13G       | Beneficial ownership report (passive)        |
| `sec::13f_hr`  | 13F-HR       | Institutional investment manager holdings    |
| `sec::def_14a` | DEF 14A      | Definitive proxy statement                   |

### Sub-Records (8-K Events, Form 4 Transactions, Form 3 Holdings)

Sub-records are **separate graph entities**, not nested properties on the parent filing. Each sub-record has its own NEID and can be queried independently. They use the same flavor as their parent filing (e.g., `sec::8_k` for 8-K events, `sec::form_4` for Form 4 transactions).

**Entity naming pattern:**

- 8-K events: `{accession_number}_evt_{n}` (e.g., `0000320193-24-000067_evt_1`)
- Form 4 transactions: `{accession_number}_trx_{n}` (e.g., `0000320193-24-000067_trx_1`)
- Form 3 holdings: `{accession_number}_holding_{n}`

**Relationships on sub-records:**

- `filed` — points to the parent filing's accession number
- `issued_by` — points to the company

**Critical querying note:** Properties like `form_8k_event`, `form_8k_item_code`, `transaction_type`, `shares_transacted`, and other sub-record-specific properties do NOT appear on the parent filing entity or the organization entity. You must traverse the graph to the sub-record entities to access them.

**Traversal path:**

```
organization --[filed]--> 8-K filing --[linked, distance 1]--> event sub-records
```

**Example: Finding 8-K event sub-records for a company:**

1. Get filing NEIDs from the organization's `filed` property
2. Filter to 8-K filings by checking `form_type == "8-K"`
3. For each 8-K filing, use a `linked` expression (distance 1, direction both) to find connected entities
4. Exclude the organization and the filing itself from results — the remaining entities are the event sub-records
5. Query those sub-record NEIDs for `form_8k_event` and `form_8k_item_code`

### `person`

A corporate insider (officer, director, or significant owner) from Form 3 or Form 4.

- Primary key: `person_cik` when available; otherwise named entity resolution.
- Entity resolver: named entity, mergeable. Strong ID = `person_cik` when present.

### `financial_instrument`

A tradeable security identified by CUSIP, from 13F-HR filings.

- Primary key: `cusip_number`
- Entity resolver: named entity. Strong ID = `cusip_number`.

## Entity Relationships

> **Sub-record traversal:** Sub-records (8-K events, Form 4 transactions, Form 3 holdings) are separate document entities. To find them, traverse from the parent filing using a `linked` expression (distance 1). The sub-record's `filed` property points back to the parent filing, and `issued_by` points to the company.
