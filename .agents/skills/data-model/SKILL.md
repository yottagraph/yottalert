# Data Model Skill

This skill provides documentation for the Lovelace data model, describing the entity types, properties, and relationships that each fetch source contributes to the knowledge graph.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- Understand what entity types exist (organizations, people, filings, etc.)
- Know what properties are available on entities
- Understand relationships between entity types
- Look up the schema definition for a data source

## Quick Start

1. **Identify the source**: Determine which data source is relevant (EDGAR for SEC filings, FRED for economic data, etc.)
2. **Read the DATA_DICTIONARY.md**: Get human-readable documentation of entities, properties, and relationships
3. **Check schema.yaml**: For machine-readable schema definitions including flavors, properties, and extraction rules

## File Types

### DATA_DICTIONARY.md

Human-readable documentation containing:

- **Source Overview**: What the source is and how data flows through the pipeline
- **Entity Types**: What flavors (entity types) this source creates, with primary keys and resolver behavior
- **Properties**: Field definitions with examples and derivation notes
- **Relationships**: How entities connect to each other

### schema.yaml

Machine-readable schema definition containing:

- **flavors**: Entity type definitions with mergeability and strong ID properties
- **properties**: Field definitions with types, descriptions, and domain flavors
- **relationships**: Link definitions with domain and target flavors
- **extraction**: Whether the schema is open or closed for each category
