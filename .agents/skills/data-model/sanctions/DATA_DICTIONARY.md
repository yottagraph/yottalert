# Data Dictionary: Sanctions

## Purpose

Sanctioned persons and organizations from [OpenSanctions](https://www.opensanctions.org/), which aggregates sanctions lists from US OFAC, UK HM Treasury, EU, UN, Swiss SECO, and others. Input is OpenSanctions JSON (arrays or newline-delimited). Static reference data loaded in bulk. Only entities with `target: true` are ingested.

`Record.Source`: `sanctions-source`
