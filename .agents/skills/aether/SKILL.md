# Aether Skill

Aether is an app framework built on Nuxt 3 + Vue 3 + Vuetify 3 + TypeScript,
running on the Lovelace platform (entities, news, filings, sentiment,
relationships, events). It follows standard Nuxt conventions -- pages in
`pages/`, components in `components/`, composables in `composables/`, server
routes in `server/api/`. Auth0 is wired in automatically. Apps can also
contain ADK **agents** (`agents/`, deployed to Vertex AI Agent Engine) and
**MCP servers** (`mcp-servers/`, deployed to Cloud Run) that deploy
independently from the web app.

This skill is the single entry point for conventions, architecture, and
copy-paste patterns. Read this file first, then follow the links below for
the specific topic you need.

## How to Use This Skill

**Always read this `SKILL.md` file whenever you are working on any code in
an Aether tenant project.** It is the index of what guidance is available to you.

Do _not_ read every topic file up front. Instead, once you've read this
index, use the "When to read" column in the table below to decide which
specific topic files are relevant to the task in front of you, and read
only those. Re-consult this index whenever the task shifts (e.g. from
pages to agents, or from data access to deployment) to pick up any new
topics that apply.
